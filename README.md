<strong>This is my Landing Page Project for The Odin Project.</strong>
<br/><br/>

<h1>Project Design</h1>
In this project I have decided to go slightly off of Project Spec designed a Landing Page called 'Happy Paws Dog Walking'.
<br/><br/>
<h3>To design this page I made use of:</h3>

- Flex Boxes Layouts.
- HTML / CSS.
- External Font Imports.
  <br/><br/>

<h1>Current Issues</h1>

It should be noted that although the webpage uses Flexbox, it is not fully responsive at this time.

This Website <u>will have issues</u> displaying correctly on Mobile Devices.
<br/><br/>

<h1>Project Learnings</h1>
During this project, this was my first thing I had to do where I had to think of the methods of how I could make each element work together on the page from scratch. (rather than individual smaller assignments on The Odin Project)
<br/><br/>

<h3>This project exposed me to the continued use of the following:</h3>
- Flex Boxes Layouts.
- HTML / CSS.
- External Font Imports.
- Proper git workflow understanding and ensuring I committed each time I met a milestone.
- Using the Google chrome Devtools to Fault find issues.
<br/><br/>
<h3>What can be improved:</h3>

- Responsive website, make mobile friendly.
- Cleaner code. Especially from the CSS side of things.
- Could possibly simplify things.
